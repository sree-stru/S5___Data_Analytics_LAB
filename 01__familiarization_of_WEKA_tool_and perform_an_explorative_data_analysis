FAMILIARIZATION OF WEKA TOOL AND PERFORM AN EXPLORATIVE DATA ANALYSIS

WEKA Tool

Definition: WEKA is an open-source software developed in Java that provides a collection of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing tools. It is presented through a GUI and command-line interface. It is widely used for data mining classification, clustering, regression, and data visualization.
WEKA stands for: Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis.
It is a free open-source data mining and machine learning tool.

Development: Developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand.
Main data mining processes: Classification, clustering, regression, association rule mining, and visualization.
Programming: No programming needed - ideal for beginners and students.
Data support: Comes with built-in datasets and supports common file formats like ARFF, CSV, and XLSX.
Use: Useful for research, teaching, and quick ML prototyping and data analysis.

WEKA Interfaces
Explorer:
Main tool for data analysis.
Most commonly used interface, beginner-friendly.
Step-by-step machine learning workflow.
Experimenter:
Used to compare multiple algorithms on the same dataset.
Performs statistical analysis of results.
Useful for research and benchmarking.
Knowledge Flow:

Good for building custom ML pipelines.

🛠️ Procedure: How to Create/Load Data

Method 1: Create Dataset Manually in WEKA Tool
Open WEKA > click on Explorer.
Click Open file.
Choose any small ARFF file (e.g., weather.nominal.arff).
Click Edit (Opens the ARFF Viewer).
In ARFF Viewer, click Add instance to manually enter rows.
Click Edit to change attribute values.
After editing, click Save - save it as an ARFF file.

Method 2: Create Dataset in Text Editor (ARFF format)
Open any text editor (e.g., Notepad).
Write the dataset in ARFF format.
Save it as file-name.arff.
Open it in WEKA via Explorer > Open file.
How to Load an ARFF/CSV file in WEKA
Open WEKA > click on Explorer.
Click Open file.
Select your CSV file from your computer.
WEKA will automatically convert CSV to ARFF format.
The data will appear in the Preprocess tab.
After loading, click Save to export it as an ARFF file for future use.
